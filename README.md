This is an altered version of the 2010 indie game VVVVVV using the officially released source code. This is used for the experiment for my master thesis "Adaptive Checkpoints for Flow State Optimization in Video Games", as a student of the Master Game Technology at the Breda University for applied sciences.

VVVVVV by [Terry Cavanagh](http://distractionware.com/), with music by [Magnus Pålsson](http://souleye.madtracker.net/).
Source code available on [Github](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/vvvvvv).
VVVVVV is still commercially available via [thelettervsixtim.es](https://thelettervsixtim.es/) if you'd like to support the game.
