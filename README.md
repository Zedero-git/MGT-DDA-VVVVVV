This is an altered version of the 2010 indie game VVVVVV using the officially released source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/vvvvvv). This is used non-commercially for the experiment for my (Zeb De Roover) master thesis "Adaptive Checkpoints for Flow State Optimization in Video Games", as a student in the Master's program in Game Technology at the Breda University of applied sciences.

Licenses and many other files are left as-is, directly cloned from the official repository. The original VVVVVV is copyright of Terry Cavanagh © 2010-2020.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/vvvvvv).
VVVVVV is still commercially available via [thelettervsixtim.es](https://thelettervsixtim.es/) if you'd like to support the game.
